# Collections with protocols
 - Container protocol which allows to test for item membership in a collection
 - sized protocol which allows to determine the number of itmes in a collection
 - iterable protocol which yields the items in the collection one by one
 - sequence protocol which supports random read access to collections
 - set protocol which supports varous set operations such as set-intersection

## The protocols are implemented using TDD
Meaning that the tests are set first to fail and then the implemention to pass the test
The tests covers wide area but not everything
